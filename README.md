1: Returning to yourself.

This is an artwork that satirizes modern social life. In New York, you can see that everyone is very busy. I don’t want to admit but I have to say I'm one of them. It felt like I hadn't been with myself for a long time: I was always busy with my assignments and needed to go out at least six days a week.  
At the end of the year, hope you can slow down, and spend some time with yourself. Feeling about the little cute and strong inner one of you.

2: Experience HUB: Hep people experience understanding the deep meaning of certain words 

How to convey the meaning of “connection”:

The essence of connection lies in embracing the grieving face (doll) in the present moment. Everything becomes interconnected; emotions are transmitted, and positive energy, much like a temperature sensor, is conveyed forward. The connected energy diminishes the original sadness and unhappiness in the person opposite, transforming it into a smile. Thus, the interaction occurs when people hug the doll, and the screen on the computer displays a happy face.




3: Around

## **Final idea**

There are two boxes here: one for Box A.  A individuals need solitude to recharge, when we click and play game on the box A, the Box A personality self-charges its energy, and the box lights up,illuminating all the lights. Box A: One side of it features a board game. Once the challenge is completed, Box A's side finishes charging while displaying a calm screen.

When the game is completed, Box A receives a signal from Box B, indicating that B is currently feeling unhappy and needs an embrace for recharging. As these two boxes embrace each other, energy is transferred. The original expression on Box B (the screen displaying a down face) turns into a smiley face, signifying the successful completion of the charging process
