Assignment 6 

I want to create a game inspired by the airplane game I used to play when I was a child. I remember that game required a few buttons to control the movement of the airplane and shoot obstacles in front of it. If you failed to shoot the obstacles, the game would end. Taking this game as inspiration, I want to design an airplane or any other object that can be controlled using a button. Pressing the button once would mean diving down to avoid oncoming objects, and quickly pressing it twice would mean diving down rapidly. In this game, the oncoming objects are all square-shaped, which is similar to the square design I previously worked on in previous assignments.
