1: Returning to yourself.

This is an artwork that satirizes modern social life. In New York, you can see that everyone is very busy. I don’t want to admit but I have to say I'm one of them. It felt like I hadn't been with myself for a long time: I was always busy with my assignments and needed to go out at least six days a week.  
At the end of the year, hope you can slow down, and spend some time with yourself. Feeling about the little cute and strong inner one of you.

2: Experience HUB: Hep people experience understanding the deep meaning of certain words 

How to convey the meaning of “connection”:

The essence of connection lies in embracing the grieving face (doll) in the present moment. Everything becomes interconnected; emotions are transmitted, and positive energy, much like a temperature sensor, is conveyed forward. The connected energy diminishes the original sadness and unhappiness in the person opposite, transforming it into a smile. Thus, the interaction occurs when people hug the doll, and the screen on the computer displays a happy face.


3: Around

## **Final idea** 
There are two boxes here: one for introverted individuals, Box I. Because introverted individuals need solitude to recharge, when an introverted person (Box I) clicks and plays the tic-tac-toe game on the box, the Box I personality self-charges its energy, and the box lights up just like an introverted person, illuminating all the lights.

The other box is for extroverted individuals, Box E. They need external sources to gain energy. At this moment, the extroverted box feels very disheartened. When these two boxes embrace each other, energy is transferred. The original expression of Box E (the screen showing a disheartened face) turns into a smiley face because the charging process is successful.
