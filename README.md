### Using loops and repetition - Generative art

In South Korea, there are four seasons. Generally, spring has mild and sunny weather, making it a season filled with numerous festivals. People gather by the Han River to watch fireworks and enjoy cherry blossoms. Both of these are beautiful and show some patterns. In the digital world, we have the freedom to create what we can imagine. Therefore, I've combined cherry blossoms and fireworks using repetition. Just give it a try! I want to share an awesome cherry blossom firework with you!
